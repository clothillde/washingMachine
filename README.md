# Project Washing Machine - used techniques - HTML5, SASS and JavaScript with a little jQuery. 
My goal was to mostly improve my JavaScript skills that is why I still improve many things in this project.


How to use it:
1. Choose washing mode on the knob by clicking it, then press start and see what happen.
After one use you need to refresh the page.
2. Click button to set your own custom mode, then on the next page choose your own order and set time (in miliseconds) to the stages of the washing. If you click save, then you will see effects of your choice.
